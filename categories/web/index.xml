      <title>Arguments Against HTTPS</title>

      <description>Disclaimer: I think HTTPS everywhere is a generally good thing, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t unmitigated. See this earlier post about why HTTPS is good and why you should do it.
That being said, there are arguments against it that ought to be taken seriously.
Some of these arguments apply systemically, i.e., because of choices made by the browser vendors, such as the decision to mark all non-HTTPS sites as insecure by default.</description>
