      <description>Disclaimer: I think HTTPS everywhere is a generally good thing, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t unmitigated. See this earlier post about why HTTPS is good and why you should do it.
That being said, there are arguments against it that ought to be taken seriously.
Some of these arguments apply systemically, i.e., because of choices made by the browser vendors, such as the decision to mark all non-HTTPS sites as insecure by default.</description>

      <description>Respect Your Users As of July 24th, 2018, Google Chrome is visibly marking all non-HTTPS sites as &amp;ldquo;not secure&amp;rdquo;. In light of this, it might be prudent to elaborate on what exactly HTTPS is meant to do.
A site without HTTPS is vulnerable to Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks, which Troy Hunt shows off convincingly over at https://www.troyhunt.com/heres-why-your-static-website-needs-https/
That site is all about demonstrating through words, video, and actions, what happens when you don&amp;rsquo;t have HTTPS.</description>
