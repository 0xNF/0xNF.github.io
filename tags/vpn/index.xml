      <description>Good at some things, bad at others. At the most basic level, a VPN is an end-to-end service that encrypts network activity on one end and decrypts it at another. Depending on what kind of platform you are on, VPNs can be installed at different and deeper layers of the network stack.
That&amp;rsquo;s all it is. Encrypted data at one end, decrypted data at the other. Anything else is fluff, extras added on top.</description>
