# Branding Choices

Last time we looked at 7 channels and examined their branding, which included their choice of name, iconography, video style, and video information.

Today, we'll make some choices of our own. 

We're going to ask some questions here:

1. What is our channel name
1. What will our main graphics be?
    1. What will our Crest be
    2. What will our Stamp be
1. What will our videos look like?
    * What backgrounds will we use?
    * Will we have animations?
        * If so, what will our intro look like
        * What will our post-intro look like
        * Will we have a waveform of some sort?
    * Will we display artist/song/genre info?
    * Where will we display our own brand?
1. Will our thumbnails be different from the video frames?

# Channel Name

Our considerations, much like any other branding decision, are guided by a number of core ideas:


1. Do we want our name to convey particular images and values?
    * If so, does our name convey those values well?
1. How unique is our name?
1. How easily can we create graphics and visuals around it?
1. How available are the social networking handles?
1. What is the availability of domain names as close to the name as possible?
    * on this note, it is recommended to avoid unpronounced separators like dashes or underscores.
1. How likely are we to be the first result on google?

Throne + Shadow = easy to imagine
